### Description

This is a start to an Asteroids/Gradius clone. Almost all of the program is documented. It demonstrates how to use DirectX features such as: DirectDraw, Sprites, DirectInput, Collision Detection, Playing Midi's, Playing Wav's, Sound Buffers, etc. You really have to check this out, it could really help you learn DirectX. Also, please vote and give comments.
 
### More Info
 
You should have DirectX 7 installed on the computer.

This program has had some problems with several systems. On some the sounds stop playing after a while, and on others the program may not load. If this occurs, change the sprites height and width. (make it smaller)
